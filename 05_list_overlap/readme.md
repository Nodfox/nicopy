# Instructions from "practicepython.org"

Take two lists and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.

Extras:
1. Randomly generate two lists to test this
2. Write this in one line of Python (don’t worry if you can’t figure this out at this point - we’ll get to it soon)
